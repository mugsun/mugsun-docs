# GIS & maps

With `VITE_ENABLE_GIS` on, the admin registers the **GIS** menu (frontend `modules/gis`, backend `mugsun-boot-gis`). All screenshots below come from a local run of mugsun-boot + mugsun-pc (1440×900). The UI is shown in Chinese.

::: info Basemap source & copyright
The basemap in these screenshots is **Tianditu** (China's National Platform for Common Geospatial Information Services) imagery + label tiles, proxied same-origin by boot; copyright belongs to Tianditu. The admin map currently shows no attribution / map-review-number control — when publishing, label the source and review number as required by Tianditu's terms. You need to apply for your own Tianditu key.

::: tip Demo data
The analytics heatmap and region screenshots use demo events seeded into the local dev database (~150 geo-tagged events across Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities), for illustration only.

## Basemap providers `/gis/provider`

Keys are stored server-side only (SM4-encrypted); tiles are proxied through an authenticated same-origin API. A configured key is never echoed back — the input only says "leave empty to keep".

## Map workspace `/gis/workspace`

Draw points/lines/polygons, search places / POIs, switch 2D/3D and basemap styles (vector / imagery / labels). Set `gis.module.enabled` to hide the whole module.

**More → Analytics heatmap** overlays precise analytics coordinates as a heatmap layer; adjust opacity, zoom to, or remove it in the **Layers** panel.

## Examples `/gis/lab`

Runnable examples grouped by scenario: markers & overlays, tracks & fences, query & measurement, 3D tiles, data ingestion. Each can be added to the workspace.

## Spatial analysis `/gis/analyze`

Runs server-side with JTS: input is normalized to WGS84 GeoJSON and computed in meters on Web Mercator. Results can be saved as a layer or overlaid. Below: a 500 m buffer around a point near Tiananmen.

## Control layout and narrow screens {#layout}

- On the examples, layers, scenes, spatial analysis and basemap pages, the zoom buttons sit to the right of the left panel, so the panel no longer covers them. The workspace keeps its zoom buttons in the bottom-left corner.
- At viewport widths up to 768px (for example a 390px-wide phone):
  - On the layers, scenes, spatial analysis and basemap pages, the bottom hint becomes a full-width bar. Use the × on its right to hide it until you next open the page.
  - The workspace stacks its three top toolbars into full-width rows: view and basemap, scene and save, then search. 2D / 3D always stays at the far left. The bottom status bar also becomes a full-width bar, and the zoom buttons move to the top right.

## Analytics geo

The analytics overview `/track/overview` shows region distribution (from IP geolocation) and a visit heatmap (from precise coordinates). They come from different data sources.

Precise location is off by default. Turn on **Precise location** for an app under `/track/app`; the SDK reports coordinates with the session after the user grants location permission.
